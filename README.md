# 🍦 Ice Cream Revenue Predictor

This project uses a simple machine learning model to predict ice cream sales revenue based on temperature data. It's a great example of using **linear regression** to model real-world business behavior, particularly for temperature-sensitive products.

## 📊 Overview

The notebook demonstrates:

- Creating a synthetic dataset of temperature and corresponding ice cream sales revenue.
- Visualizing the data using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Building and training a **Linear Regression** model using scikit-learn.
- Evaluating model performance using standard metrics.
- Making predictions based on new temperature values.
